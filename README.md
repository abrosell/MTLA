# Mapping Emergent Patterns of Landscape Architect User Experience in Creation Games to Describe Digital Landscapes
Online Repository of graduate thesis Data/Results for completion of Master of Tropical Landscape Architecture in University of the Philippines Diliman

## Overview
This repository contains the Tableau Dashboard made for the graduate thesis entitled 'Mapping Emergent Patterns of Landscape Architect User Experience in Creation Games to Describe Digital Landscapes'. Its data set comprises of emergent codes, categories, and segments from the interviews and 2 focus group discussions in the qualitative study.

## Dashboard Sections
#### 1. Interview Codes Co-occurrence Matrix
Contains all the instances of code intersections for all the interview sessions. Each category can be filtered for specific comparisons. There is also an instance count slider to filter the number of instances.
#### 2. User/Player Profiles
A compilation of data relating to the User context. It contains the Word Clouds for the Personas and Gamers categories which show the number of total mentions. There are also co-occurrence matrices for their Age of Introduction, Hardware Acess and Preferred Features, and User Tendencies to compare relationship of users/participants of the study to the presented categories.
#### 3. Segments and Categories Suburst Diagram
A sunburst diagram showing the data hierarchy between the total segments and categories. Both can be further filtered through the dropdown features on top of the figure.
#### 4. Categories and Codes Sunburst Diagram
A sunburst diagram showing the data hierarchy between the total categories and codes. Both can be further filtered through the dropdown features on top of the figure.

## Data Visualization Guide
### Co-occurrence Matrix
Have X and Y axes of codes, grouped according to their categories. The intersections of these axes represent the number of times a particular code (X axis) was mentioned together with another code (Y axis). The resulting gradient heat map is based on the count of intersections. This quickly visualizes patterns or relationships of codes with each other in terms of intensity.
### Word Cloud
Individual text compilations of codes within a chosen category. They are depicted according to size and color which are directly proportional to the total number of mentions of that code. They serve to quickly summarize the most significant code that can represent the category.
### Sunburst Diagram
Used to display the entirety of the hierarchical relationship between the resulting codes, categories, and segments of the study. Given the sheer amount of data, the resulting diagrams are are best read in a digital format and could not be printed. Aside from hierarchy, this also informs the researcher the proportion of the results, providing more understanding which concepts are most relevant for the participants.
